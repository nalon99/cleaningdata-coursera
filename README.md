cleaningdata-coursera
=====================

Repository for various projects dealing with the Getting and Cleaning Data course through Coursera.

The script run_analysis.R reads data from the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder and creates the output file "tidydata.txt" in the same working directory. Pay attention that the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder needs to be downloaded and unzipped in your working directory from this link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

To start the script, run the R Console from the working directory and digit:
source("run_analysis.R")
